description = "Estimate confidence intervals in means of correlated time series with a small number of effective samples (like molecular dynamics simulations). If your time series is long enough that the standard error levels off completely as a function of block length, then this method is overkill and simply using a block bootstrap sampling with a sufficiently large block length is probably sufficient."
